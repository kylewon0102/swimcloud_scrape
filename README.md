# Swimcloud.py

**Swimcloud.py** is a Python script designed to scrape swimmer data from Swimcloud profiles using web scraping techniques. It retrieves information such as swimmer names, hometowns, universities, social media links (SNS), and event data such as event names and times. This data is extracted using the **BeautifulSoup** library and can be saved for further analysis or processing.

## Features

- **Retrieve swimmer data**: Extracts the swimmer's name, hometown, university, and SNS links.
- **Event data**: Scrapes event names and times from Swimcloud profiles.
- **Save data**: Saves the extracted data into text files for future use or analysis.
- **Search events**: Allows searching for specific events within the swimmer's profile.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping the data.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to Swimcloud profiles.

You can install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip3 install beautifulsoup4 requests

How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swimcloud.py.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd swimcloud.py
In the script swimcloud.py, the main functionality is encapsulated within the swimmer_class. You can create an instance of this class, update swimmer information, and save the data.

Example usage:

python
Copy code
from swimcloud import swimmer_class

# URL of the swimmer's Swimcloud profile
swimmer_url = "https://swimcloud.com/swimmer_profile"

# Create a swimmer object
swimmer = swimmer_class(swimmer_url)

# Update swimmer information from the profile
swimmer.update_info()

# Save swimmer's information to a text file
swimmer.save_info_as_file("swimmer_data.txt")

# Search for a specific event
event = swimmer.search_event("100m Freestyle")
print(event)
The save_info_as_file method will save the swimmer's data into a .txt file with the swimmer's details, SNS links, and event list.

How It Works
Swimmer Profile: The swimmer_class takes a URL to a Swimcloud profile and extracts the swimmer's name, hometown, university, and SNS links.
Event Data: The class also scrapes the swimmer's event data such as event names and times.
Data Storage: Once the data is retrieved, it can be saved into a .txt file or used further in other projects.
Search Events: The search_event method allows searching specific events from the swimmer's event list.
